 # Practice_lab_01-neural_networks
>Learn about neural networks and how to use them for classification tasks.

>Use the TensorFlow framework to build a neural network with just a few lines of code.

>Then, dive deeper by learning how to code up your own neural network in Python, "from scratch".

>Learn more about how neural network computations are implemented efficiently using parallel processing (vectorization).
