    Returns the new centroids by computing the means of the
    data points assigned to each centroid.

    Args:
        X (ndarray):   (m, n) Data points
        idx (ndarray): (m,) Array containing index of closest centroid for each
                       example in X. Concretely, idx[i] contains the index of
