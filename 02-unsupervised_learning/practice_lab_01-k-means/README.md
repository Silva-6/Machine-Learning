# K-means Clustering 

In this exercise, you will implement the K-means algorithm and use it for image compression. 

* You will start with a sample dataset that will help you gain an intuition of how the K-means algorithm works.
+ After that, you will use the K-means algorithm for image compression by reducing the number of colors that occur in
an image to only those that are most common in that image.
