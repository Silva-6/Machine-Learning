# Supervised Learning
>Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy & scikit-learn.

>Build & train supervised machine learning models for prediction & binary classification tasks,
including linear regression & logistic regression.
## Objectives:
>* Define a regression model
>* Implement and visualize a cost function
>* Implement gradient descent
>* Optimize a regression model using gradient descent
>* Use vectorization to implement multiple linear regression
>* Use feature scaling, feature engineering, and polynomial regression to improve model training
>* Implement linear regression in code
>* Use logistic regression for binary classification
>* Implement logistic regression for binary classification
>* Address overfitting using regularization, to improve model performance
