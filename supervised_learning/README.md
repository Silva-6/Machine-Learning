# Supervised Learning
## Objectives:
* Define a regression model
* Implement and visualize a cost function
* Implement gradient descent
* Optimize a regression model using gradient descent
* Use vectorization to implement multiple linear regression
* Use feature scaling, feature engineering, and polynomial regression to improve model training
* Implement linear regression in code
* Use logistic regression for binary classification
* Implement logistic regression for binary classification
* Address overfitting using regularization, to improve model performance
